# Artist-Remover
Ever get stuck in an Artist's waitlist? where it just seems like no matter what you do, their songs get added to your playlists on Spotify? I did, so I made this.

Basically, this connects to your Spotify Account, and from there it takes the artist name and deletes it from your playlist.
While you would have to manually use this program to do so, I made it automatically by leveraging a cloud server and attaching the progam as an executable file that can be runned by the server scheduler.
